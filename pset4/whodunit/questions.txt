1.  Header that declares sets of integer types having specified width.
2.  The point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t is to assign a specified amount of memory for each defined type.
3.  BYTE: 1 byte, DWORD: 4 bytes, LONG: 4 bytes, and WORD: 2 bytes.
4.  The first two bytes of any BMP are 0x42 and 0x4D (BM in ASCII).
5.  bfSize: size, in bytes, of the bitmap file.
    biSize: number of bytes required by the structure.
6.  If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down, begining at the top-left pixel.
7.  biBitCount specifies the BMPâ€™s color depth.
8.  fopen might return NULL in lines 24 and 32 of copy.c if the command line arguments for input and output files are not valid paths or files can't be opened.
9.  The third argument to fread is always 1 because the second argument define the size of the block to read to the total size of the struct that we want read, so we need to read only once.
10. If bi.biWidth is 3, line 65 of copy.c assign the value 3 to padding.
11. fseek set the file pointer position.
12. We pass SEEK_CUR as third argument for fseek to change the location of the pointer from its current location.
